# ClassicalMusicAnalyzer

A Deep-Learning based binary audio classifier, done with Brian Rappaport, Cornell University. CS 6780 final project..

Our goal was to see if such network can distinguish between two vastly different types of classical music. We chose two composers, Johann Sebastian Bach and Claude Debussy, as our binary labels and manually scrapped audio recordings from YouTube.

We model audio signal as (1) a time-dependent sequence of frequency coefficients and (2) a 2D image (via a spectrogram). For each interpretation, we apply recurrent nets and convolutional nets, DL architecture known to excel in these tasks.
